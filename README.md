# Predicting_Soil_Properties_Using_Hyperspectral_Images

The primary objective of this project is to design a hyperspectral imaging-based system that can visualize and interpret soil properties with high spatial and spectral resolution.
This project bridges a key gap between raw hyperspectral data acquisition and meaningful soil interpretation. In the broader context, the project supports the goals of sustainable agriculture by
minimizing overuse of fertilizers, improving resource allocation, and enhancing productivity through informed decision-making.
